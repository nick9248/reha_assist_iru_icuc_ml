Machine Learning Approach for Predicting NBE Values
I'll create a detailed outline for predicting the probability of the nbe variable from your patient consultation dataset. Let's document each step carefully to ensure we build an effective and interpretable model.
1. Data Understanding and Exploration
First, let's analyze the dataset structure and characteristics to determine the most appropriate ML approach:

Dataset Overview

Examine data dimensions (rows, columns)
Analyze data types and potential conversions needed
Identify unique patients and consultation patterns
Assess temporal aspects with accident_date and contact_date


Descriptive Statistics and Distributions

Calculate summary statistics for numerical features
Visualize distributions of key variables (p_score, fl_score, p_status, fl_status)
Analyze target variable (nbe) distribution and potential class imbalance
Examine telephone_category distribution


Data Quality Assessment

Check for missing values
Identify outliers or anomalous values
Evaluate temporal consistency between accident_date and contact_date
Assess data completeness and consistency


Feature Relationships

Analyze correlations between features
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable
Examine time-based patterns in the data
Study multi-consultation patterns for individual patients



2. Data Preprocessing

Anonymization

Because of the data privacy we should anonymize the dataset. for the each we should assign a unique id to each patient.

Feature Engineering

Create temporal features (days since accident, days between consultations)
Derive patient-level aggregations (average scores, score trajectories)
Generate consultation sequence features (first, second, last consultation)
Extract patterns from multiple consultations per patient


Data Preparation

Handle missing values with appropriate imputation strategies
Encode categorical variables
Scale/normalize numerical features if needed
Split data into training, validation, and test sets (considering patient-level splits)



3. Model Selection and Development

Baseline Models

Start with simple models
Evaluate performance metrics focusing on probability estimation
Establish baseline performance benchmarks


Advanced Models

Implement advanced methods
Consider deep learning approaches if appropriate:

Neural networks for sequential consultation data
Attention mechanisms for temporal patterns


Evaluate specialized models for time-series medical data


Model Evaluation Strategy

Use stratified cross-validation (preserving patient-level integrity)
Focus on probability calibration metrics (Brier score, log loss)
Assess discrimination ability (AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves)
Consider patient-level evaluation metrics



4. Model Training and Tuning

Hyperparameter Optimization

Implement grid or random search for hyperparameter tuning
Optimize for probability calibration and discrimination
Consider Bayesian optimization approaches


Model Validation

Validate models using held-out data
Implement cross-validation with patient-level splits
Ensure models generalize well across different patient groups



5. Model Interpretation and Insights

Feature Importance Analysis

Calculate and visualize feature importance scores
Implement SHAP values for detailed feature contribution analysis
Identify key predictors of nbe outcomes


Probability Calibration

Ensure predicted probabilities are well-calibrated
Implement calibration techniques if necessary
Visualize calibration curves


Patient-Level Interpretation

Develop case studies for typical patient trajectories
Analyze how consultation patterns affect predictions
Create visual explanations for stakeholders



6. Final Model Selection and Implementation

Model Comparison

Compare performance metrics across models
Select final model based on accuracy, calibration, and interpretability
Document model strengths and limitations


Production Pipeline

Design a reproducible pipeline for new predictions
Develop monitoring metrics for model performance
Create documentation for model usage
